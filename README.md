### Hi! :)

Here you have some of the programs I make in C++. You can quickly compile them with Dev-C++

Info about the programs:
- get_a_roman_number.cpp

  If you introduce a number less than 4000, the program show you the Roman number.
  
  
- greater_than_zero.cpp

  The program asks you to enter a number. If you enter 0, the program cuts off and returns the number of numbers greater than zero that you have entered.
  
 
- n_total_sum.cpp

  With this program you can calculate the total sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, where n is the number you choose.
