### Hi! :)

Here you have some of the programs I make in C++. You can quickly compile them using Dev-C++ https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

Info about the programs:

- fibonacci.cpp

  In this program you can enter the position up to which you want to view the Fibonacci series.

- get_a_roman_number.cpp

  If you introduce a number less than 4000, the program show you the Roman number.
  
- greater_than_zero.cpp

  The program asks you to enter a number. If you enter 0, the program cuts off and returns the number of numbers greater than zero that you have entered.
  
- guess_random_number.cpp

  In how many tries will you be able to guess a random number?
  
- iterate_subtraction_addition.cpp

  This program returns the result of the operation: 1-2+3-4+5...-n, where 'n' is the number you enter on the screen
  
- n_total_sum.cpp

  With this program you can calculate the total sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, where n is the number you choose.
